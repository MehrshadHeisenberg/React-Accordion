- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first experience with Shadcn/ui and I must admit that it is absolutely wonderful and makes the work much faster. I will definitely use it for my other projects as well. I needed a lot of researching for how to using it properly but at the end I think I did well.
